In many cases Ctrl+Alt+T will also bring up a terminal windows.</p> <p>If you have configured the remote server with your SSH public key (see \u201cPassword-less SSH login\u201d in the EXTENSION section of this post), then you\u2019ll need to point to the location of the private part as proof of identity with the \u201c-i\u201d switch, typically like this:</p> <p><code>ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa support@192.123.321.99</code></p> <p>A very slick connection process can be setup with the .ssh/config feature - see the \u201cSSH client configuration\u201d link in the EXTENSION section below.</p> <p>On an MacOS machine you\u2019ll normally access the command line via Terminal.app - it\u2019s in the Utilities sub-folder of Applications.</p> <p>On recent Windows 10 versions, the same command-line client is now available, but must be enabled (via \u201cSettings\u201d, \u201cApps\u201d, \u201cApps &amp; features\u201d, \u201cManage optional features\u201d, \u201cAdd a feature\u201d, \u201cOpenSSH client\u201d).</p> <p>Alternatively, you can install the Windows Subsystem for Linux which gives you a full local command-line Linux environment, including an SSH client - ssh.</p> <p>There are also GUI SSH clients for Windows (PuTTY, MobaXterm) and MacOS (Terminal.app, iTerm2). If you use Windows versions older than 10, the installation of PuTTY is suggested.</p> <p>Regardless of which client you use, the first time you connect to your server, you may receive a warning that you\u2019re connecting to a new server - and be asked if you wish to \u201ccache the host key\u201d. Do this. Now, if you get a warning in future connections it means that either: (a) you are being fooled into connecting to a different machine or (b) someone may be trying a \u201cman in the middle\u201d attack.</p> <p>So, now login to your server as your user - and remember that Linux is case-sensitive regarding user names, as well as passwords.</p> <p>Once logged in, notice that the \u201ccommand prompt\u201d that you receive ends in  $ - this is the convention for an ordinary user, whereas the \u201croot\u201d user with full administrative power has a # prompt.</p> <p>Try these simple commands:</p> <p><code>ls</code></p> <p><code>uptime</code></p> <p><code>free</code></p> <p><code>df -h</code></p> <p><code>uname -a</code></p> <p>If you\u2019re using a password to login (rather than public key), then now is a good time to ensure that this is very strong and unique - i.e. At least 10 characters - because your server is fully exposed to bots that will be continuously attempting to break in. Use the passwd command to change your password. To do this, think of a new, secure password, then simply type passwd, press \u201cEnter\u201d and give your current password when prompted, then the new one you\u2019ve chosen, confirm it  - and then WRITE IT DOWN somewhere. In a production system of course, public keys and/or two factor authentication would be more appropriate.</p> <p>It\u2019s very handy to be able to cut and paste text between your remote session and your local desktop, so spend some time getting confident with how to do this in your setup.</p> <p>Log out by typing exit.</p> <p>You\u2019ll be spending a lot of time in your SSH client, so it pays to spend some time customizing it.

So, we\u2019ll need to first install a standard bundle of common compilers and similar tools. On Ubuntu, the package of such tools is called \u201cbuild-essential\u201d. Install it like this:</p> <p><code>sudo apt install build-essential</code></p>"},{"location":"17/#getting-the-source","title":"GETTING THE SOURCE","text":"<p>First, test that you already have <code>nmap</code> installed, and type <code>nmap -V</code>  to see what version you have.

Next, type: <code>which nmap</code> - to see where the executable is stored.</p> <p>Now let\u2019s go to the \u201cProject Page\u201d for the developers  http://nmap.org/ and grab the very latest cutting-edge version. Look for the download page, then the section \u201cSource Code Distribution\u201d and the link for the \u201cLatest development nmap release tarball\u201d and note the URL for it - something like:</p> <pre><code> https://nmap.org/dist/nmap-7.70.tar.bz2\n</code></pre> <p>This is version 7.70, the latest development release when these notes were written, but it may be different now. So now we\u2019ll pull this down to your server. The first question is where to put it - we\u2019ll put it in your home directory, so change to your home directory with:</p> <p><code>cd</code></p> <p>then simply using <code>wget</code> (\u201cweb get\u201d), to download the file like this:</p> <p><code>wget -v https://nmap.org/dist/nmap-7.70.tar.bz2</code></p> <p>The -v (for verbose), gives some feedback so that you can see what\u2019s happening. Once it\u2019s finished, check by listing your directory contents:</p> <p><code>ls -ltr</code></p> <p>As we\u2019ve learnt, the end of the filename is typically a clue to the file\u2019s format - in this case  \u201c.bz2\u201d signals that it\u2019s a tarball compressed with the bz2 algorithm. While we could uncompress this then un-combine the files in two steps, it can be done with one command - like this:</p> <p><code>tar -j -x -v -f   nmap-7.70.tar.bz2</code></p> <p>....where the -j means \u201cuncompress a bz2 file first\u201d, -x is extract, -v is verbose - and -f says \u201cthe filename comes next\u201d. Normally we\u2019d actually do this more concisely as:</p> <p><code>tar -jxvf  nmap-7.70.tar.bz2</code></p> <p>So, lets see the results,</p> <p><code>ls -ltr</code></p> <p>Remembering that directories have a leading \u201cd\u201d in the listing, you\u2019ll see that a directory has been created :</p> <pre><code> -rw-r--r--  1 steve  steve  21633731    2011-10-01 06:46 nmap-7.70.tar.bz2\n drwxr-xr-x 20 steve  steve  4096        2011-10-01 06:06 nmap-7.70\n</code></pre> <p>Now explore the contents of this with <code>mc</code> or simply <code>cd nmap-7.70</code> - you should be able to use <code>ls</code> and <code>less</code> find and read the actual source code. Even if you know no programming, the comments can be entertaining reading.</p> <p>By convention, source files will typically include in their root directory a series of text files in uppercase such as: README and INSTALLATION. Look for these, and read them using <code>more</code> or <code>less</code>. It\u2019s important to realise that the programmers of the \u201cupstream\u201d project are not writing for Ubuntu, CentOS  - or even Linux. They have written a correct working program in C or C++ etc and made it available, but it\u2019s up to us to figure out how to compile it for our operating system, chip type etc. (This hopefully gives a little insight into the value that distributions such as CentOS, Ubuntu and utilities such as <code>apt</code>, <code>yum</code> etc add, and how tough it would be to create your own Linux From Scratch)</p> <p>So, in this case we see an INSTALL file that says something terse like:</p> <pre><code> Ideally, you should be able to just type:\n\n./configure\nmake\nmake install\n\nFor far more in-depth compilation, installation, and removal notes\nread the Nmap Install Guide at http://nmap.org/install/ .\n</code></pre> <p>In fact, this is fairly standard for many packages. Here\u2019s what each of the steps does:</p> <ul> <li><code>./configure</code> - is a script which checks your server (ie to see whether it\u2019s ARM or Intel based, 32 or 64-bit, which compiler you have etc). It can also be given parameters to tailor the compilation of the software, such as to not include any extra support for running in a GUI environment - something that would make sense on a \u201cheadless\u201d (remote text-only server), or to optimize for minimum memory use at the expense of speed - as might make sense if your server has very little RAM. If asked any questions, just take the defaults - and don\u2019t panic if you get some WARNING messages, chances are that all will be well.</li> <li><code>make</code>  - compiles the software, typically calling the GNU compiler <code>gcc</code>. This may generate lots of scary looking text, and take a minute or two - or as much as an hour or two for very large packages like LibreOffice.</li> <li><code>make install</code> - this step takes the compiled files, and installs that plus documentation to your system and in some cases will setup services and scheduled tasks etc. Until now you\u2019ve just been working in your home directory, but this step installs to the system for all users, so requires <code>root</code> privileges. Because of this, you\u2019ll need to actually run: <code>sudo make install</code>. If asked any questions, just take the defaults.</li> </ul> <p>Now, potentially this last step will have overwritten the <code>nmap</code> you already had, but more likely this new one has been installed into a different place.</p> <p>In general  /bin is for key parts of the operating system,  /usr/bin for less critical utilities and /usr/local/bin for software you\u2019ve chosed to manually install yourself. When you type a command it will search through each of the directories given in your PATH environment variable, and start the first match. So, if /bin/nmap exists, it will run instead of /usr/local/bin - but if you give the \u201cfull path\u201d to the version you want - such as /usr/local/bin/nmap - it will run that version instead.</p> <p>The \u201clocate\u201d command allows very fast searching for files, but because these files have only just been added, we\u2019ll need to manually update the index of files:</p> <p><code>sudo updatedb</code></p> <p>Then to search the index:</p> <p><code>locate bin/nmap</code></p> <p>This should find both your old and copies of <code>nmap</code></p> <p>Now try running each, for example:</p> <p><code>/usr/bin/nmap -V</code></p> <p><code>/usr/local/bin/nmap -V</code></p> <p>The <code>nmap</code> utility relies on no other package or library, so is very easy to install from source. Most other packages have many \u201cdependencies\u201d, so installing them from source by hand can be pretty challenging even when well explained (look at: http://oss.oetiker.ch/smokeping/doc/smokeping_install.en.html for a good example).</p> <p>NOTE: Because you\u2019ve done all this outside of the <code>apt</code> system, this binary won\u2019t get updates when you run <code>apt update</code>. Not a big issue with a utility like <code>nmap</code> probably, but for anything that runs as an exposed service it\u2019s important that you understand that you now have to track security alerts for the application (and all of its dependencies), and install the later fixed versions when they\u2019re available.

Normally this shell is bash, so when you string commands together to make a script the result can be called either a \u2018\u201cshell script\u201d, or a \u201cbash script\u201d.</p> <p>Why make a script rather than just typing commands in manually?</p> <ul> <li>It saves typing. Remember when we searched through the logs with a long string of <code>grep</code>, <code>cut</code> and <code>sort</code> commands? If you need to do something like that more than a few times then turning it into a script saves typing - and typos!</li> <li>Parameters. One script can be used to do several things depending on what parameters you provide</li> <li>Automation. Pop your script in /etc/cron.daily and it will run each day, or install a symlink to it in the appropriate /etc/rc.d folder and you can have it run each time the system is shut down or booted up.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"20/#start-with-a-shebang","title":"START WITH A SHEBANG!","text":"<p>Scripts are just simple text files, but if you set the \u201cexecute\u201d permissions on them then the system will look for a special line starting with the two characters \u201c#\u201d and \u201c!\u201d - referred to as the \u201cshebang\u201d (or \u201ccrunchbang\u201d) at the top of the file.</p> <p>This line typically looks like this:</p> <pre><code> #!/bin/bash\n</code></pre> <p>Normally anything starting with a \u201c#\u201d character would be treated as a comment, but in the first line and followed by a \u201c!\u201d, it\u2019s interpreted as: \u201cplease feed the rest of this to the /bin/bash program, which will interpret it as a script\u201d. All of our scripts will be written in the bash language - the same as you\u2019ve been typing at the command line throughout this course - but scripts can also be written in many other \u201cscripting languages\u201d, so a script in the Perl language might start with <code>#!/usr/bin/perl</code> and one in Python <code>#!/usr/bin/env python3</code></p>"},{"location":"20/#your-first-script","title":"YOUR FIRST SCRIPT","text":"<p>You\u2019ll write a small script to list out who\u2019s been most recently unsuccessfully trying to login to your server, using the entries in /var/log/auth.log.</p> <p>Use <code>vim</code> to create a file, <code>attacker</code>, in your home directory with this content:</p> <pre><code> #!/bin/bash\n#\n#   attacker - prints out the last failed login attempt\n#\necho \"The last failed login attempt came from IP address:\"\ngrep -i \"disconnected from\" /var/log/auth.log|tail -1| cut -d: -f4| cut -f7 -d\" \"\n</code></pre> <p>Putting comments at the top of the script like this isn\u2019t strictly necessary (the computer ignores them), but it\u2019s a good professional habit to get into.</p> <p>To make it executable type:</p> <p><code>chmod +x attacker</code></p> <p>Now to run this script, you just need to refer to it by name - but the current directory is (deliberately) not in your $PATH, so you need to do this either of two ways:</p> <pre><code> /home/support/attacker\n ./attacker\n</code></pre> <p>Once you\u2019re happy with a script, and want to have it easily available, you\u2019ll probably want to move it somewhere on your $PATH - and /usr/local/bin is a normally the appropriate place, so try this:</p> <p><code>sudo mv attacker /usr/local/bin/attacker</code></p> <p>\u2026and now it will Just Work whenever you type <code>attacker</code></p>"},{"location":"20/#extending-the-script","title":"EXTENDING THE SCRIPT","text":"<p>You can expand this script so that it requires a parameter and prints out some syntax help when you don\u2019t give one.
