# Day 0 - Get Your Own Server

* [Complementary video](https://youtube.com/live/_-6UYOjRIVQ?feature=share)

## INTRO

First, you need a server. You can't learn about administering a remote Linux server without having one of your own - so today we're going to get one - completely free!

Through the magic of Linux and virtualization, it's now possible to get a small Internet server setup almost instantly - and at a very low cost. Technically, what you'll be doing is creating and renting a VPS  ("Virtual Private Server"). In a data center somewhere, a single physical server running Linux will be split into a dozen or more Virtual servers, using the KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) feature that's been part of Linux since early 2007.

In addition to a hosting provider, we also need to choose which "flavor" of Linux to install on our server. If you're new to Linux then the range of "distributions" available can be confusing - but the latest LTS ("Long Term Support") version of Ubuntu Server is a popular choice, and what you'll need for this course.

## Do you a free server I can use?

Well, not quite yet.

[SadServers](https://sadservers.com) has a **beta scenario**s: ["Resumable Server": Linux Upskill Challenge](https://sadservers.com/scenario/luc)

This is a Debian 11 server without a challenge; it's for you to do as you please. Please be mindful that it still has some limitations (there's still no outgoing Internet access) and there can be some issues.


## So, what are the options?

* [In a Local Server](https://linuxupskillchallenge.org/00-Local-Server.md)
* [In the Cloud (with providers like DigitalOcean, Linode and Vultr)](https://linuxupskillchallenge.org/00-VPS-small.md)
* [In the Cloud (with providers like AWS, Azure and Google Cloud)](https://linuxupskillchallenge.org/00-VPS-big.md)

Check your options, see what fits you best. Take a minute to watch the video, it will answer most of your questions. When you have your server ready, you can start the challenge.
